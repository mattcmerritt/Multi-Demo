  content: "The King was found dead in his office\r\n\tDied around 4:30 PM\r \n\t\tFrom
    anaphylactic shock\n\nA plate of fairly fresh chocolate peanut butter cookies
    was found at the scene\n\nTwo people had eaten peanut butter cookies (there were
    two plates found)\n\nNo one had a scheduled meeting with him that day, so it
    is suspected that it had to have been a family member who could easily enter
    and exit the area without notice.\r"
